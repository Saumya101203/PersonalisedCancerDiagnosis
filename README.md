# PersonalisedCancerDiagnosis
## Overview

Personalized Cancer Diagnosis is a machine learning-based approach to predict cancer types based on patient data. This project utilizes advanced data science techniques to provide accurate and personalized diagnostic insights.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training and evaluation using machine learning.
- Prediction of cancer diagnosis based on input data.
- Visualization of model performance and results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries :

-- numpy
-- pandas
-- matplotlib
-- seaborn
-- scikit-learn
-- imbalanced-learn (for handling imbalanced datasets)
-- joblib (for model persistence)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PersonalizedCancerDiagnosis.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```
cd PersonalizedCancerDiagnosis
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
2. Run PersonalizedCancerDiagnosis.ipynb step-by-step.
3. Observe the model training, evaluation, and prediction results.

## Dataset

- The dataset used for training should be placed in the appropriate directory.
- Ensure proper preprocessing before feeding into the model.

## Model

- Machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or deep learning approaches may be used.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

- Model performance is visualized using plots and evaluation metrics.
- The final model provides predictions for personalized cancer diagnosis.
